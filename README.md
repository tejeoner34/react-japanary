# Japanary

## Description

Project created with two goals, first one practice React as the front end development library and sencond, create an application that would help me with my Japanese language studies.

As a Japanese learner, I realized the amount of time spent when creating Anki flashcards. First we need to look for the work in a dictionary, then go to Anki, create a new card, look for some sample sentence...etc.

With this application you can do eveything in just one click. Plus it gives you the option to receive extra information using OpenAI API.

## Thoughts

Application that I keep updating as I have been using it everyday for the past 7 months. I keep trying to add interesting features to improve the learning experience. For example, recently added the possibility to add images to the flashcard body content.
